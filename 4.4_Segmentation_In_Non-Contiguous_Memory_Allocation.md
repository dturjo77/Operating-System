Segmentation
    - 1. Separation of Views: With paging, the user’s idea of how their program’s memory is organized gets separated from where it actually sits in the computer’s       memory (RAM). This mismatch becomes a challenge.
    - 2. What is Segmentation?: Segmentation is a memory technique that respects the user’s view, letting them divide their program into parts that make sense to them.
    - 3. Logical Address Space: A program’s memory is seen as a collection of segments, based on how the user imagines it (e.g., code, data, stack).
    - 4. Segment Definition: Each segment is identified by a segment number and an offset (written as <segment-number, offset> or {s, d}). The segment number picks the segment, and the offset shows the position within it.
    - 5. Variable Segments: A process is split into variable-sized segments according to the user’s needs, like grouping related tasks together.
    - 6. Paging vs. User View: Paging is an OS-focused method that chops all processes into fixed-size pages. It doesn’t care if related parts (like a function) end up on different pages.
    - 7. Efficiency Drop: The OS might split a single function across multiple pages, loading them at different times. This ignores the user’s view and can slow things down.
    - 8. Segmentation Benefit: Segmentation is better because it groups similar functions into segments (e.g., main code in one, library functions in another), matching the user’s logic and improving efficiency.
    - 9. Advantages
        - a. No Internal Fragmentation: Segments fit the data perfectly, avoiding wasted space within them (unlike fixed-size pages).
        - b. Contiguous Within Segment: Each segment is stored together, making operations within it fast and smooth.
        - c. Smaller Segment Table: The table tracking segments is usually smaller than a page table, speeding up lookups.
        - d. Efficient Function Grouping: The compiler can place related functions in one segment, boosting system performance.
    - 10. Disadvantages
        - a. External Fragmentation: Variable-sized segments leave gaps when removed, making it hard to fit new segments (external fragmentation).
        - b. Swapping Trouble: Different segment sizes complicate swapping them in and out of memory, slowing the process.
    - 11. Modern Systems
    Modern computers use a hybrid approach, combining segmentation and paging. This blends segmentation’s user-friendly design with paging’s efficient memory use, tackling their individual weaknesses.

Internal Fragmentation vs External Fragmentation

- Internal Fragmentation
        - What It Is: This happens when you allocate a fixed-size block of memory to a process, but the process doesn’t use all of it. The unused part stays locked and can’t be given to anyone else.
        - Example: Imagine you have a 4KB box (fixed-size memory block) and a 3KB file to store. The file fits, but 1KB is left empty inside the box. That 1KB is wasted—it’s internal fragmentation because it’s trapped within the allocated block.
        - Where It Occurs: Common in paging, where memory is divided into fixed-size pages, and a process might not fill the entire page.
        - Impact: Wastes some memory, but the waste is predictable and manageable.

- External Fragmentation
        - What It Is: This occurs when free memory is scattered into small, non-contiguous chunks (holes) that are too small to use, even though the total free space might be enough for a new process.
        - Example: Suppose you have a 10KB memory. You remove a 4KB process and a 3KB process, leaving two 3KB gaps and a 1KB gap. A new 5KB process can’t fit anywhere because the gaps aren’t together—it’s external fragmentation because the waste is outside the allocated blocks.
        - Where It Occurs: Common in segmentation or dynamic partitioning, where memory blocks vary in size and leave irregular gaps.
        - Impact: Can waste a lot of memory, and fixing it (e.g., with compaction) takes time and effort.

- Key Differences
        - Location: Internal fragmentation is waste inside an allocated block; external fragmentation is waste between allocated blocks.
        - Cause: Internal comes from fixed-size allocations (like paging); external comes from variable-size allocations (like segmentation).
        - Fix: Internal is harder to avoid but limited; external can be reduced with techniques like compaction, but it’s trickier.

- Fun Analogy
        - Internal Fragmentation: It’s like renting a 10-seat table for 8 people—2 seats are empty and unusable while the table is booked.
        - External Fragmentation: It’s like having 5 single chairs scattered around a room—enough for 5 people, but they can’t sit together, so the space is wasted.
