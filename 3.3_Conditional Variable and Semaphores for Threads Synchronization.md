 🧠 Imagine You and Your Friends Playing a Game 🎮
      You all want to take turns to use something like a swing, a toy, or even a game controller. But you need rules so no one fights and everyone plays nicely. That’s where conditional
      variables and semaphores help!

   1. **🕓 Conditional Variable What is it?**

       It’s like saying:
       🧒: “I’ll wait here until someone tells me it’s my turn!”
       You can only wait if you're holding the "I'm waiting" badge (lock).
       Once you're waiting, you give the badge back and go sit quietly.
       When someone says, "Hey, it's your turn!" (notify), you grab the badge again and go play.

       - a. Definition: A conditional variable is a tool that allows a thread to pause and wait until a specific condition is met.
       - b. Works with a Lock: It needs a lock to function properly.
       - c. How It Works: A thread can wait only after acquiring a lock. When it waits, it releases the lock and pauses until another thread signals that the condition is met. Once awakened,
          it immediately re-acquires the lock and resumes.
       - d. Why Use It?
          i. To Avoid Busy Waiting: It prevents a thread from wasting CPU time by constantly checking a condition.
       - e. Contention: There’s no contention issue since threads wait passively rather than compete.

      🟢 Why it's cool?
       You don’t need to keep checking over and over (no "busy waiting").
       It's quiet and polite. No pushing!

   2. **🔢 SemaphoresWhat is it?**

        It’s like a counter that shows how many toys are left.
        If it says 3, then 3 kids can play at the same time.
        If it says 0, no toys left — you wait in line.

        - a. Definition: A semaphore is a synchronization method using an integer to manage access to resources.
        - b. Resource Count: The integer value represents the number of available resources.
        - c. Multiple Threads: It allows several threads to enter and execute the critical section concurrently, up to the resource limit.
        - d. Resource Access: Unlike mutex (which lets one thread access a resource at a time), semaphores allow multiple threads to share a limited number of resource instances.
        - e. Binary Semaphore: Has a value of 0 or 1, acting like a mutex lock.
           - i. Aka Mutex Locks: It’s essentially a two-state lock.
        - f. Counting Semaphore:
           - i. Range: Can have any positive integer value, not just 0 or 1.
           - ii. Use: Controls access to a resource with multiple instances.
        - g. Avoiding Busy Waiting: Instead of waiting actively, a thread blocks itself when the semaphore value is zero. It joins a waiting queue, switches to a waiting state, and lets
           the CPU scheduler pick another process.
        - h. Restarting Blocked Processes: When another process signals the semaphore, the blocked process is woken up (moved from waiting to ready state) and added to the ready queue for execution.

        🔁 Two types:
        - Binary Semaphore (0 or 1): Like only 1 swing – one kid at a time (same as a lock).
        - Counting Semaphore (0,1,2...): Like many toys – more kids can play together.

   🚦 How it works?
       If no toy is free, you go sit in a waiting line.
       When someone finishes, they say "next!", and the next kid in line comes to play.
       This keeps things orderly and no one fights or keeps checking like, "Is it my turn yet?!"

   🎯 Main Goal:
       Both conditional variables and semaphores are like playground rules that make sure:
       - Everyone gets a fair turn.
       - No chaos.
       - No one keeps shouting or waiting forever.
