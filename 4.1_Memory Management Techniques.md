1. Multi-Programming Environment
   In a multi-programming system, multiple processes (programs or tasks) are loaded into the main memory and placed in a Ready Queue. 
   The operating system manages these processes to keep the CPU utilization high and ensure the computer remains responsive to users. 
   Instead of running one process at a time, the CPU switches between processes, allowing efficient use of resources. This requires 
   careful memory management to allocate and share memory among the processes.

2. Need for Memory Management
   To support multiple processes, the operating system must keep several processes in the main memory at once. This involves sharing 
   the memory efficiently and managing it for all running processes. Without proper management, processes could overwrite each other’s 
   data, leading to system crashes or incorrect results.

3. Logical versus Physical Address Space
   Memory management involves two types of addresses: logical addresses and physical addresses. These are handled in different address spaces.

   a. Logical Address Space
      i. Definition: A logical address is generated by the CPU during the execution of a program. It represents the address of an instruction 
         or data that the process needs.
      ii. User Perspective: The user or program accesses this address as the basis of the process’s operations.
      iii. Indirect Access: Users don’t directly access the physical memory. Instead, they use logical addresses, which are translated into 
         physical addresses.
      iv. Virtual Nature: Logical addresses are also called virtual addresses because they don’t exist physically in the hardware. 
         They are an abstraction created by the operating system.
      v. Program-Generated Addresses: The set of all logical addresses generated by a program is referred to as the Logical Address Space.
      vi. Range: The logical address space ranges from 0 to a maximum value, depending on the program’s size and the system’s addressing capability.

    b. Physical Address Space
      i. Definition: A physical address is the actual location in the main memory where data or instructions are stored. It is loaded into the 
         memory-address register of the physical memory.
      ii. Physical Location: The physical address corresponds to a specific location in the main memory.
      iii. Direct Access Limitation: Users cannot access physical addresses directly. Access is mediated through the logical-to-physical mapping.
      iv. Correspondence: The set of physical addresses corresponding to the logical addresses is commonly known as the Physical Address Space.
      v. MMU Role: This mapping is managed by the Memory Management Unit (MMU), a hardware device.
      vi. Range: The physical address range is calculated as (R + 0) to (R + max), where R is the base value (stored in a relocation register) 
         and max is the maximum offset. This ensures each process’s memory is relocated to a unique physical space.
 
4. How OS Manages Isolation and Protection? (Memory Mapping and Protection):
   - a. The OS provides the **Virtual Address Space (VAS)** concept to separate memory for each process.
   - b. It determines the range of legal addresses a process can access.
   - c. A relocation register (Base address, e.g., 100040) and limit register (e.g., 74600) define the legal address range. 
        The process can only access addresses within this range.
   - d. Each logical address must be less than the limit register value.
   - e. The **MMU** dynamically maps logical addresses to physical addresses by adding the relocation register value.
   - f. When a process is selected for execution, the dispatcher loads the relocation and limit registers. This protects the OS and 
        other users’ data by checking addresses generated by programs.
   - g. Any attempt by a user-mode program to access OS or other users’ memory triggers a trap, treated as a fatal error.
   - h. Address Translation: The CPU generates a logical address. If it’s within the limit, the MMU adds the relocation value 
        to get the physical address for main memory access. If not, an addressing error occurs.

5. Allocation Method on Physical Memory:
   - a. Contiguous Allocation:** Processes are stored in a single, continuous memory block.
   - b. Non-contiguous Allocation:** Processes can be stored in non-adjacent memory areas.

6. Contiguous Memory Allocation:
   - a. Each process occupies a single continuous memory block.
   - b. Fixed Partitioning:
     - i. Main memory is split into fixed partitions of equal or different sizes.
     - ii. Limitations:
       - 1. Internal Fragmentation: Wasted memory occurs if a process is smaller than its partition.
            if the size of the process is lesser then the total size of the partition then some size of the partition gets wasted and remain unused. This is                    wastage of the memory and called internal fragmentation. 
       - 2. External Fragmentation: Scattered free spaces can’t be used if not contiguous.
             The total unused space of various partitions cannot be used to load the processes even though there is space available but not in the contiguous form. 
       - 3. Size Limitation: A process can’t load if it exceeds the largest partition size.
            If the process size is larger than the size of maximum sized partition then that process cannot be loaded into the memory. Therefore, a limitation can              be imposed on the process size that is it cannot be larger than the size of the largest partition.
       - 4. Low degree of multi-programming: The number of processes is fixed and doesn’t adapt to partition size.
            In fixed partitioning, the degree of multiprogramming is fixed and very less because the size of the partition cannot be varied according to the size               of processes. 
    - c. Dynamic Partitioning:**
      - i. Partition size is set when a process is loaded. In this technique, the partition size is not declared initially. It is declared at the time of process              loading. 
      - ii. Advantages:
        - 1. No internal fragmentation.
        - 2. No size limit on processes.
        - 3. Improved multi-programming.
     - iv. Limitation:
       - 1. External Fragmentation: Non-contiguous free spaces may block loading a larger process despite available memory.
