1.Main Disadvantage of Dynamic Partitioning: (External Fragmentation)
   - Explanation: In dynamic partitioning, memory is allocated to processes in variable-sized partitions. Over time, as processes are loaded and removed, free memory       becomes scattered into small, non-contiguous chunks (external fragmentation). This leads to inefficient memory use because even if the total free memory is            sufficient, it may not be contiguous enough to accommodate a new process.
   - Solutions:
    - a. Compaction: This involves moving allocated memory blocks together to create a single large contiguous free space. However, compaction introduces overhead due          to the time and resources needed to relocate processes. 
    - b. Need for a Dynamic Mechanism: A more flexible and optimal mechanism is required to efficiently load processes into memory, avoiding fragmentation issues.              This leads to the concept of paging.

2.Idea Behind Paging:
   - Concept: Paging divides a process’s memory into fixed-size blocks called pages and divides physical memory into fixed-size blocks called frames. Pages of a            process are mapped to available frames, which do not need to be contiguous.
   - Addressing the Fragmentation Issue:
    - a. Paging eliminates external fragmentation because processes are split into fixed-size pages that can be placed in any available frame, regardless of whether            the frames are contiguous. 
    - b. If there are two non-contiguous free holes in memory (e.g., 1KB each), a 2KB process can be divided into two 1KB pages. Each page can be allocated to one of           the 1KB holes, allowing the process to be loaded without requiring contiguous memory. 
    - c. This approach solves the problem of external fragmentation because the operating system can allocate non-contiguous memory blocks efficiently, as long as the          total free memory is sufficient.
     
2.1.Example Scenario:
   - Problem: Suppose there are two non-contiguous free memory holes of 1KB each, and a process requires 2KB of memory.
   - Contiguous Allocation: Not possible, as there is no single 2KB contiguous block available (external fragmentation).
   - Paging Solution: The 2KB process is divided into two 1KB pages. Each page is allocated to one of the 1KB free holes. The operating system uses a page table to         map the process’s logical pages to the physical frames, allowing the process to run without needing contiguous memory.

3. What is Paging? 
   - a. Non-Contiguous Space: Imagine your computer’s memory as a huge toy box where you store all your toys (processes). Normally, all the pieces of one toy (like a big Lego set) need to stay together in one spot. But with paging, you can scatter those pieces anywhere in the box, as long as there’s room. This flexibility is called non-contiguous—the pieces don’t have to be side by side!
   - b. Avoids Fragmentation: Sometimes, when you take toys out, you’re left with tiny gaps in the box that are too small for new toys. This is external fragmentation, and it wastes space. Paging gets rid of this problem by organizing everything into neat, same-sized chunks, so there are no awkward gaps.
   - c. Dividing Memory: Paging works by chopping the toy box (physical memory) into fixed-size sections called Frames, and each toy’s instructions (logical memory) into matching chunks called Pages. Both frames and pages are the same size, like using the same-sized boxes for all your toy parts.
   - d. Page Size: The size of these boxes is usually decided by the computer’s brain (processor), often 4,096 bytes (or 4KB), which is like a small stack of papers. Newer computers might use different sizes to make things work even better, depending on what’s needed.
   - e. Page Table (Your Memory Guide):
      - i. Mapping: Think of the page table as a checklist that tells you which page (toy part) goes into which frame (box spot). It’s like a map for your scattered toys!
      - ii. Base Address: It also gives the starting location of each frame in the toy box, so the computer knows where to start looking.
    - f. Address Breakdown: When the computer wants to find a toy part, it gets an address from the program. This address is split into two parts: a page number (p) (which box to check) and a page offset (d) (how far into that box). The page number helps the computer use the page table to find the right frame.
    - g. Storage: The page table is stored in the toy box (main memory) when a new toy (process) is set up. Its starting point is saved in a special label called the process control block (PCB), like a tag on the box.
    - h. PTBR (The Pointer): There’s a special marker called the page table base register (PTBR) that points to the current page table. When the computer switches to a new toy (context-switching), it only needs to update this marker—no big reorganization needed!
      
3.1. Example Scenario Made Simple
   - Situation: Your toy box has two small empty spots, each 1KB (like two tiny drawers), and you want to fit a 2KB toy (a bigger set).
   - Contiguous Allocation: If everything must stay together, it fails because there’s no single 2KB space (external fragmentation strikes again!).
   - Paging Solution: You break the 2KB toy into two 1KB pieces (pages). Each piece fits into one of the 1KB drawers (frames). No need for them to be next to each other—problem solved!
     
3.2. Why This Works So Well
   - Paging is like a smart way to pack your toys. Instead of needing one long shelf, you use small, same-sized boxes and a guide (page table) to keep track. This avoids wasted space and lets the computer use memory flexibly, even when it’s all mixed up.
