1.Main Disadvantage of Dynamic Partitioning: (External Fragmentation)
   - Explanation: In dynamic partitioning, memory is allocated to processes in variable-sized partitions. Over time, as processes are loaded and removed, free memory       becomes scattered into small, non-contiguous chunks (external fragmentation). This leads to inefficient memory use because even if the total free memory is            sufficient, it may not be contiguous enough to accommodate a new process.
   - Solutions:
    - a. Compaction: This involves moving allocated memory blocks together to create a single large contiguous free space. However, compaction introduces overhead due          to the time and resources needed to relocate processes. 
    - b. Need for a Dynamic Mechanism: A more flexible and optimal mechanism is required to efficiently load processes into memory, avoiding fragmentation issues.              This leads to the concept of paging.
     
2.Idea Behind Paging:
   - Concept: Paging divides a process’s memory into fixed-size blocks called pages and divides physical memory into fixed-size blocks called frames. Pages of a            process are mapped to available frames, which do not need to be contiguous.
   - Addressing the Fragmentation Issue:
    - a. Paging eliminates external fragmentation because processes are split into fixed-size pages that can be placed in any available frame, regardless of whether            the frames are contiguous. 
    - b. If there are two non-contiguous free holes in memory (e.g., 1KB each), a 2KB process can be divided into two 1KB pages. Each page can be allocated to one of           the 1KB holes, allowing the process to be loaded without requiring contiguous memory. 
    - c. This approach solves the problem of external fragmentation because the operating system can allocate non-contiguous memory blocks efficiently, as long as the          total free memory is sufficient.
     
3.Example Scenario:
   - Problem: Suppose there are two non-contiguous free memory holes of 1KB each, and a process requires 2KB of memory.
   - Contiguous Allocation: Not possible, as there is no single 2KB contiguous block available (external fragmentation).
   - Paging Solution: The 2KB process is divided into two 1KB pages. Each page is allocated to one of the 1KB free holes. The operating system uses a page table to         map the process’s logical pages to the physical frames, allowing the process to run without needing contiguous memory.
