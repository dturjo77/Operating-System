## 1. Multi-Programming Environment
In a multi-programming system, multiple processes (programs or tasks) are loaded into the main memory and placed in a Ready Queue. The operating system manages these processes to keep the CPU utilization high and ensure the computer remains responsive to users. Instead of running one process at a time, the CPU switches between processes, allowing efficient use of resources. This requires careful memory management to allocate and share memory among the processes.

##2. Need for Memory Management
To support multiple processes, the operating system must keep several processes in the main memory at once. This involves sharing the memory efficiently and managing it for all running processes. Without proper management, processes could overwrite each other’s data, leading to system crashes or incorrect results.

## 3. Logical versus Physical Address Space
Memory management involves two types of addresses: logical addresses and physical addresses. These are handled in different address spaces.

a. Logical Address Space
i. Definition: A logical address is generated by the CPU during the execution of a program. It represents the address of an instruction or data that the process needs.
ii. User Perspective: The user or program accesses this address as the basis of the process’s operations.
iii. Indirect Access: Users don’t directly access the physical memory. Instead, they use logical addresses, which are translated into physical addresses.
iv. Virtual Nature: Logical addresses are also called virtual addresses because they don’t exist physically in the hardware. They are an abstraction created by the operating system.
v. Program-Generated Addresses: The set of all logical addresses generated by a program is referred to as the Logical Address Space.
vi. Range: The logical address space ranges from 0 to a maximum value, depending on the program’s size and the system’s addressing capability.

b. Physical Address Space
i. Definition: A physical address is the actual location in the main memory where data or instructions are stored. It is loaded into the memory-address register of the physical memory.
ii. Physical Location: The physical address corresponds to a specific location in the main memory.
iii. Direct Access Limitation: Users cannot access physical addresses directly. Access is mediated through the logical-to-physical mapping.
iv. Correspondence: The set of physical addresses corresponding to the logical addresses is commonly known as the Physical Address Space.
v. MMU Role: This mapping is managed by the Memory Management Unit (MMU), a hardware device.
vi. Range: The physical address range is calculated as (R + 0) to (R + max), where R is the base value (stored in a relocation register) and max is the maximum offset. This ensures each process’s memory is relocated to a unique physical space.
